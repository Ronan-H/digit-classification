# Digit Classification

## What this is
This is my 4th year *emerging technologies* assignment. There are two main parts: a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which trains a neural network on the [MNIST dataset of handwritten digits] step by step, in order to later classify digits drawn by a user using a simple web applicatoin written using the [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) web application framework.
